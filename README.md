# 💫 Hey there! I’m Rameen Shakeel 💁🏽‍♀️

🎓 From Psychology major to Digital Marketer to Data-Driven Dreamer, my journey’s been anything but ordinary.  
I began by understanding people’s minds 🧠 and eventually fell in love with understanding patterns in data.  

📊 Working in digital marketing showed me the power of creativity, but it also opened my eyes to something deeper:  
How unstructured data could turn into meaningful insights that drive real impact.  
That’s when I understood the power of *data*, and the rest is history.  

Now I’m pursuing my **Master of Science in Business Analytics** at **UIC**, where I blend strategy, creativity, and analytics to tell stories that matter.
